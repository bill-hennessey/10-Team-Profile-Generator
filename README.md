# 10-Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

I had such a hard time with this project, therefore it is extremely incomplete. I still dont have an understanding of testing so I saved that until the end while I worked on other areas. Unfortunately I couldn't make those work either. The end result is an app that asks you questions about your team, compiles the data into an array and does nothing else with it. I needed more time. Nothing else to say. I will likely be resubmitting this later.

My tutor Jeremy Jones was very useful in getting me as far as I got.
